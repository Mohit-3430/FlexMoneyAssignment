2. Next steps is for verfication, which essentially verifies the registration status of user and heads them to payment.
3. All the information is presented here about the user and the subscription status.
4. Users can pay the amount and choose batch if required again (they can choose bacth in step 1 as well), the pay button here siulates the payment system.
5. At any point in time, to check the subscription status the `last_paid` field in db is used to verify in the verify stage.

<summary>Docker</summary>

Have containarized the application to make it compatible to develop and deploy

- Both the frontend and the backend have been containerised
- The individual docker files are present in the directories name `Dockerfile`
- environment variables have been used to build the images and not used during the compose procedure.
- Finally the whole setup has been made for using multi-container setup with ease.

Steps to reproduce:

- After cloning the repo add the `.env` files in the both directories
  - for client side add `VITE_SERVER_URL`
  - for server side add `DATABASE_URL`
- Build the images using `docker build` command
- `docker-compose.yml` is the compose file
  - Use `docker-compose build` (if images are not there)
  - Use `docker-compose up` to run the services
